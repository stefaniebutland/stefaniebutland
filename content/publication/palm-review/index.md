This paper was my favourite collaboration. A group of women in the lab got together to tackle a problem with a short turnaround time. So we considered, What does this review need to say? In what order? What things do we know that can help others' understanding? Who's going to write what? 

We worked around a big table, and talked, and expressed opinions, and laughed. We felt like we all contributed equally. Now this paper has a nice number of citations and I'm so proud of how it came to be.
