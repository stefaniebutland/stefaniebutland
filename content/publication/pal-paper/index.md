My first first-author paper. Accidental discovery. Told the story the way I wanted to tell it.

I was trying to clone and sequence a short stretch of DNA of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) gene from the Jackpine tree (_Pinus banksiana_) to complete the sequencing of the full gene. Foreshadowing: It was accepted at the time, that angiosperms (flowering plants) had multiple genes encoding the PAL protein, whereas gymnosperms (e.g. conifers) had only a single gene for PAL. When I compared the first bit of sequence (importantly, obtained using PCR primers that bound evolutionarily conserved regions) to what we already had, there were differences, so I assumed I had grabbed DNA from a different Pinus by accident. I repeated this, ensuring I had the right DNA sample, and found a third version of the sequence! What felt like grabbing the wrong sample tube turned into a legit research project and my first first-author paper that changed the dogma. Gymnosperm PAL is also encoded by a multigene family. 

Oh yeah, and one of the two reviews came back as a hand-written note saying no corrections were needed prior to publication.

PAL is my favourite gene because it lured me to bioinformatics in the late 90's. 

> Look! When you align the amino acid sequences of PAL proteins from dicot and monocot plants, you can see conserved similarities and differences! I wonder if that has something to do with enzyme function ;-)

> What?! Histidine ammonia-lyases that occur in animals and bacteria (and not plants or yeasts) appear to have evolved from a common ancestor with phenylalanine ammonia lyases that occur in plants and yeasts (and not animals or bacteria)! 

I even have an email from Russell Doolittle to support that hunch.

Once I realized I could learn more about PAL, and faster, by comparing sequences from free public databases, I was hooked. I even started a database of gymnosperm intron lengths (with pen on a single piece of paper). I knew I needed to "do" bioinformatics from then on, and used this grassroots experience to talk my way into a job in a bioinformatics core facility with Francis Ouellette.
