My second first-author paper arose when Blair Leavitt asked "could you find all the genes in the human genome that have CAG repeats that encode polyglutamine tracts?" The idea was to identify candidate genes, that are like the huntingtin gene whose CAG-tract expansion causes Huntington disease. My answer was "sure, but I don't know how". Very shortly after that I participated in Lincoln Stein's Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory course. Ewan Birney taught us about the Ensembl Perl API ...

In a 2003 poster about this project, I said things like "openly available" ...
