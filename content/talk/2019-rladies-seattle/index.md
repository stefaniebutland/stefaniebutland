I am the Community Manager for an organization of R practitioners...but I am not an R practitioner. For the first 1.5 years in my job, this was a feature, but lately it has felt more like a bug. In this talk I will introduce rOpenSci, our packages, and our system for transparent software peer review, and then share my story of starting to learn R by (not so) passive absorption of information and best practices from R-Ladies, rOpenSci, and the broader R world.
