The rOpenSci project is a non-profit initiative founded as a grassroots effort in 2011. We have evolved into a truly global community of researchers and data scientists who are R users and developers from a wide range of disciplines. rOpenSci advocates for a culture of open and reproducible research. We do this by creating technical infrastructure in the form of carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data sources on the web. We have developed a highly successful model for peer review of scientific software that provides transparent, constructive and collegial review of R packages.

Our community is our best asset. We are building social infrastructure in the form of a welcoming and diverse community. rOpenSci.org hosts blog posts by authors and reviewers of onboarded packages to share both functionality and lessons learned; we promote these on social media to bring their work to a wider audience. Our discussion forum, community calls and annual hackathon-flavored unconference are designed to share best practices and to build a trust network for the often challenging discussions about doing research more reproducibly.
