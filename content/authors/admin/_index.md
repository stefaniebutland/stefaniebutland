I'm a compulsive people-connector and knowledge-sharer, a community manager, and scientist. I am actively involved with the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement as one of the inaugural Community Engagement Fellows, a mentor, and member. My research life involved bacteria, plants, insects, and mammals, first at the bench and then on a laptop. As rOpenSci's first Community Manager from 2016 to 2022, I helped build up the social and technical infrastructure for open and reproducible research with shared data and reusable software.
