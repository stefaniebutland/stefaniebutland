I am the Community Manager for rOpenSci and a 2017 AAAS Community Engagement Fellow. I'm a biologist, bioinformatician, and compulsive people-connector and knowledge-sharer. My research has been in bacteria, plants, insects and mammals, first at the bench and then on a laptop. At rOpenSci I'm helping building up the social and technical infrastructure for open and reproducible research with shared data and reusable software.
